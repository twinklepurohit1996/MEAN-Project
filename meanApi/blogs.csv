He defined machine learning as – a “Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. In a very layman’s manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. The process starts with feeding good quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using the data and different algorithms.
